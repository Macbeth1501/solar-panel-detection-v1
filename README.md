# Solar Panel Extraction from Satellite Imagery

## Overview
This project uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 instance segmentation model to detect and extract solar panels from satellite images. 

## Features
- Instance segmentation using YOLOv8  
- Custom-trained model on a specialized dataset  
- Future updates will include dataset improvements, model refinements, and deployment  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-panel-extraction.git

2. Install dependencies:  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Navigate to the `main_code` directory:  cd main_code

4. Run the 'main.py' file: python main.py


## Dataset  
The model was trained on approximately 1600 satellite images sourced from various platforms like Bhoonidhi. These images were then manually annotated to identify solar panels for training the YOLOv8 instance segmentation model.
